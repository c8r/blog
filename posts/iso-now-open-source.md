# Iso: Reducing The Barrier to Entry for Component Based UI Development

# Iso: Component Based UI Development without the Overhead

- We love Open source software
- we think Code should be for everyone
- Current tooling is powerful but working at a higher level of abstraction
- Getting started with modern front end tooling comes with a lot of assumptions
	- terminal, command line
	- Bundlers and app setup
	- IDEs and text editors
	- Git
- Creating UI directly in the medium is the best approach
- No handoff/minimize QA and design bugs
- Removing barriers to entry
- Component based UI is the future
- Better design tools
- Too good of an idea to keep closed
- Help from our community

- we have a lot of ideas for where tooling like this can go, but we only have so many hours in the day

- should designers Code is the wrong question to ask
- If you want to, it shouldn't be hard to get started
- Shouldn't everyone Code?

Shoutouts
- Glitch
- Codesandbox
- Create react app
- Egghead, etc
